# SEOPAGE1-Task

## Project Setup

1. Clone github repository on your local machine

```
git clone <repo link>
```

2. Initially you won't see the `node_modules` folder. Next thing you need to do after cloning the repo,  
   Go to the `server` folder and run

```bash
npm install
```

It'll install all the dependencies and package needed inside the node_modules.
Do the same for `client` folder.

> Once done, you're ready to start working.
